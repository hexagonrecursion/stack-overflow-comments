# Should be English
```
[Posts on Stack Overflow have to be in English](https://stackoverflow.com/help/non-english-questions)
```

# Image should be text
```
Please [edit] your post to add code and data as text ([using code formatting](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#code)), not images. Images: A) don't allow us to copy-&-paste the code/errors/data for testing; B) don't permit searching based on the code/error/data contents; and [many more reasons](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/285557/). Images should only be used, in addition to text in code format, if having the image adds something significant that is not conveyed by just the text code/error/data. See [mcve] on what code is required.

# Answer

## Should be a question
```
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](https://stackoverflow.com/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](https://stackoverflow.com/tour).
```

## Should be a comment under question
```
This does not provide an answer to the question. Once you have sufficient reputation you will be able to [comment on any post](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment); instead, [provide answers that don't require clarification from the asker](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/214173/why-do-i-need-50-reputation-to-comment-what-can-i-do-instead).

## Me too
```
Please don't add Me too as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question. If you have a different but related question, then [ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you are interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-up) it, leave a [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment), or start a [bounty](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/set-bounties) once you have enough [reputation](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation).
```

## Thanks
```
Please don't add "thanks" as answers. Invest some time in the site and you will gain sufficient privileges to [upvote](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-up) answers you like, which is the Stack Overflow way of saying thank you.
```

## Link-only
```
A link to a solution is welcome, but please [edit] your answer to [quote](https://stackoverflow.com/help/referencing) the most relevant part of the page you are linking to in case the target page becomes unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/). 
```

## Same user; identical ansewrs under multiple questions
```
Welcome to stack overflow. Please do not post the same answer under multiple questions. If the questions are duplicates, you can [flag one to be closed as a duplicate of another once you have enough reputation](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/flag-posts). If the questions are different, please tailor your answer to each question.
