# Should be a question
```
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](https://stackoverflow.com/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](https://stackoverflow.com/tour).

# Should be a comment under question
```
This does not provide an answer to the question. Once you have sufficient reputation you will be able to [comment on any post](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment); instead, [provide answers that don't require clarification from the asker](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/214173/why-do-i-need-50-reputation-to-comment-what-can-i-do-instead).

# Image should be text
```
Please [edit] your post to add code and data as text ([using code formatting](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#code)), not images. Images: A) don't allow us to copy-&-paste the code/errors/data for testing; B) don't permit searching based on the code/error/data contents; and [many more reasons](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/285551/why-should-i-not-upload-images-of-code-data-errors/285557#285557). Images should only be used, in addition to text in code format, if having the image adds something significant that is not conveyed by just the text code/error/data. See [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example on what code is required.

# Me too answer
```
Please don't add Me too as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question. If you have a different but related question, then [ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you are interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/vote-up) it, leave a [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/comment), or start a [bounty](https://stackoverflow.com/help/privileges/set-bounties) once you have enough [reputation](https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation)https://stackoverflow.com/help/whats-reputation.
